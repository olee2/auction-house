Semester Project 2 - Noroff
[Live Site](http://the-auction-house.netlify.app)

## Description

In this project, I developed an auction website enabling users to list and bid on items. Upon registration, users are allocated 1000 credits to use for buying or selling items, while non-registered users can browse listings but cannot place bids.

Key features implemented include user registration (restricted to users with a stud.noroff.no email), login, logout, and avatar updates. Registered users can view their credit balance, create listings with a title, deadline, media gallery, and description, and bid on others' listings. Additionally, registered users can view bids on listings and use their credits to place bids. An inbuilt search feature allows unregistered users to peruse the listings.
